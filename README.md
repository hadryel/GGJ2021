You're a lighthouse keeper guiding ships to their destiny during a thunderstorm night. Find the ships wandering the misty ocean and guide then to safety, making sure to avoid the dangers of the ocean.

### Gameplay
* Guide the lighthouse light through the map using WASD
* Press Space to lock the light to a ship 
* Once located, give WASD commands to direct the ship in a direction - it takes time to be processed
* Avoid the hazards of the map and guide the ships to the port
* Ships that reach one side of the map reappear on the opposite side
* Guide ship to the heart bottle to recover one life
